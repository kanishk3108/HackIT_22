INSERT MODE -

To enter the insert mode, type i (for “insert”) and now the keys will behave as 
you’d expect. You can type normally until you want to make a correction, save 
the file, or perform another operation that’s reserved for command mode or last-line mode.
 To get out of insert mode, hit the Escape key.

COMMAND MODE -

all the alphanumeric keys are bound to commands, rather than inserting those characters.

LAST LINE MODE -

pressing the colon key, like this: : After pressing this key, you'll see a colon character
appear at the beginning of the last line of your vi editor window, and your cursor will be
moved to that position.
